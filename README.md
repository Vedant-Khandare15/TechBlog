# TechBlog

TechBlog is a blogging platform that streamlines the process of creating, editing, and publishing blog posts. 

## Motivation 

The motivation behind this project is to allow users to seamlessly author and publish their blog posts. The project is designed to leverage technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets and utilize a database (MySQL) to provide a space to curate and store blog posts and user information. 

## Architecture overview 

TechBlog uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Servlets for server-side logic that manages requests, executes database operations and displays information to the end-user. It employs MySQL as the database to hold the blog posts and user information. 

In designing the system, the project made deliberate choices to ensure optimum performance, scalability, and security.

## Getting started 

To get started with TechBlog, you need to install and configure a few core software packages that include the Apache Tomcat server, Java Development Kit (JDK), and MySQL database system. You can find installation instructions for these tools respective to your OS. 

After setting up the required environment, developers can dive into the codebase by importing the project into their favorite IDE â€” for example, Apache NetBeans. 

Once the environment setup is complete and the project is running locally on a developers machine, they can begin implementing new features, translating user stories into the codebase, and performing removal of bugs or vulnerabilities as directed by the project's maintainers.

## Usage 

TechBlog's main features revolve around authoring blog posts (CRUD operations). However, the platform is envisioned to also include a robust user authentication system, blog post management, and possibly a comments section for user engagement on published blog posts.
